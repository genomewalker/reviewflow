Paper Review Platform - Input Files
====================================

Add your files here to use the command-line setup:

1. REQUIRED: Reviews file
   - reviews.txt (or reviews.pdf, reviews.docx)
   - The reviewer comments you received from the journal

2. OPTIONAL: Manuscript file
   - manuscript.pdf (or manuscript.txt, manuscript.docx)
   - Your submitted paper
   - Used to extract statistics and data for responses

3. OPTIONAL: supplementary/ folder
   - Add any supporting data files
   - The AI can reference these when generating responses

File naming tips:
- Include "review" in the filename for reviewer comments
- Include "manuscript" or "paper" for your submission
- Create a "supplementary" folder for data files

After adding files, run:
  node setup.js

Or use the web interface:
  npm start
  (then open index.html in your browser)
